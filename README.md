## 1. Project Overview

This project implements a multi-process drone simulation system using **Ncurses** for visualization and **Named Pipes (FIFOs)** for inter-process communication. The architecture follows a **Star Topology** centered around a **Blackboard Server**.
In the final phase (Assignment 3), the system extends to support **Multiplayer Networking** via TCP Sockets.This allows two instances of the simulator (Server and Client) to connect over a network, synchronizing drone positions in real-time.

## 2.Evolution of the Project:

**Assignment 1:** Implemented the core simulation, physics engine, collision detection, and UI.

**Assignment 2:** Added system reliability via a Watchdog process and safe File Logging.

**Assignment 3 :** Added distributed capabilities via TCP Sockets, enabling Multiplayer functionality.

**Simulation Demo:**
The simulation runs across three synchronized terminal windows:

* UI Map : Visualizes the drone, targets, and obstacles.

* UI Input : Handles keyboard control and displays real-time telemetry.

* Watchdog : Monitors the health status of all active processes.

**Goal:** 
* Standalone Mode:  Navigate a drone (Blue +) to collect sequential targets (Green 1–9) while avoiding repulsive obstacles (Yellow o), all while the Watchdog ensures system stability.
* Multiplayer Mode:  Navigate freely while avoiding the other player (rendered as an obstacle).

## 3. System Architecture
The system utilizes a centralized architecture where the Blackboard acts as the server. All other processes (Drone Dynamics, UI, Obstacles, Targets) act as clients that communicate exclusively through the Blackboard.(Note: The Watchdog operates as a separate supervisor parallel to this topology).

### Communication Protocol
* Local IPC : Named Pipes (FIFOs) for internal processes.

* Remote IPC: TCP Sockets for Server-Client communication (Assignment 3).

* Non-Blocking I/O: The server uses O_NONBLOCK to ensure the simulation runs smoothly without hanging on empty pipes.
## 3. Assignment 2 Features (New)

The second phase of the project introduces system monitoring and safety mechanisms.

### A. Watchdog Process :

A cyclic process that monitors the health of all other active components.

* Polling: Wakes up every $T$ seconds (configurable).

* Mechanism: Sends Signal 0 to check if a PID is alive.

* Alerts: If a process crashes, it logs an alert to system.log and visually flags it as "NOT RESPONDING" in the Watchdog Window.

### B. Safe File Logging : 

To prevent race conditions when multiple processes write to logs simultaneously, the system implements File Locking (fcntl).

* Process List: All processes register their Name and PID in process_list.txt upon startup.

* Logs: Two distinct log files are maintained:

      - watchdog.log: For routine health checks.

      - system.log: for the critical errors and state changes.

## 4. Assignment 3 Features (Networking): 
### A. Operation Modes
The game behavior changes significantly depending on the mode selected at startup. This design ensures the same codebase can handle single-player logic and distributed networking logic.

* Standalone (Legacy Mode):

This mode runs the full simulation locally for single-player practice. Random targets and obstacles are generated automatically to provide a challenge, and the Watchdog process remains active to monitor system reliability.

* Server (The Host):
Acts as the host for a multiplayer session by opening Port 8080. It disables local obstacle generators and the Watchdog to prevent synchronization issues, relying instead on the connected client to serve as the dynamic obstacle.

* Client (The Guest):
Connects to the Server's IP address to join an existing session. It automatically synchronizes its map configuration with the host and disables local generators and monitoring, focusing entirely on real-time interaction with the remote player.

### B.Network Protocol :
This defines the "Language" the two computers speak. It is strictly synchronous (Step-by-Step) to prevent data corruption.

* Handshake (The Setup):

ok $\to$ ook: Confirms connection stability. "Are you there?" -> "Yes, I am here."

size $\to$ sok: The Server dictates the Map Width/Height. The Client receives these dimensions, resizes its window if necessary, and confirms receipt.

* Exchange (The Loop):

drone → dok: "Here are my coordinates." -> "Data received (OK)."

obst → pok: "Where are you?" -> "Here are my coordinates (as an obstacle)." -> "Data received (OK)."

* Note: To the local player, the remote player is treated mathematically as an Obstacle (O), triggering the repulsion force logic.
### C.Technical Implementation :
* Packet Handling: Implemented a "Smart Reader" (byte-by-byte) to resolve TCP packet merging issues.

* Rate Limiting: Decouples network I/O (10Hz) from physics calculation (100Hz) to prevent input lag.
## 5. Components and Algorithms : 

This section details the logic implemented in each source file.

### A. Main Process (`src/main.c`)

#### **Role**
Process Launcher and Lifecycle Manager.

#### **Primitives**
`fork()`, `exec()`, `signal()`, `mkfifo()`

#### **Logic**
- Mode Selection: Prompts user to select Standalone, Server, or Client mode.
- itialization: Creates all Named Pipes (FIFOs).
- Process Management: Forks internal processes (Blackboard, Dynamics).
- Conditional Launch: 
      * If Standalone: Forks Generators (Obstacles, Targets) and Watchdog.

      * If Multiplayer: Skips Generators and Watchdog.
- New: Registers its own PID for monitoring.

#### **Shutdown Strategy** 
Upon receiving `SIGINT`, the main process sends SIGTERM to all child PIDs and unlinks (deletes) the pipes to ensure a clean exit.


### B. Blackboard Server (`src/blackboard.c`)

#### **Role**
Central State Manager and  Message Router.

#### **Primitives**
`open(O_RDWR)`, `read(O_NONBLOCK)`, `write()`

#### **Algorithm (Loop 1000 Hz):**
1. Read Inputs: Drain pipes from UI Input and Dynamics to get local commands and position.
2. Handle Environment:
      * If Standalone: Read from local Obstacle and Target pipes.
      * If Multiplayer: Call `socket_manager` to exchange position data with the remote player (Network I/O rate-limited to 10Hz).
3. Broadcast: Send current state (Drone, Obstacles, Targets) to UI Map and Dynamics.

If Distance < 10m:
`F_rep += (1/Distance - 1/Rho) * (1/Distance²)`

2. Calculate Total Force:
`F_total = Command_Force + F_rep`

3. Euler Integration:

            `dy = target.y − drone.y`

      b. Compute distance to the target:
           ` dist = sqrt(dx² + dy²)`

      c. If the drone is inside the attraction radius `(dist < ATTRACTION_RHO)`:
            Apply attraction:
            `F_att.x = ATTRACTION_ETA * dx`
            `F_att.y = ATTRACTION_ETA * dy`

3. Return the attraction force vector `F_att`

### Controls

Use the Input Window to pilot the drone.

* E / C — Increase Up / Down force

* S / F — Increase Left / Right force

* D — Brake (reset all forces)

* R / Z / V / X — Diagonal thrust

* ESC — Quit simulation

### Select Operation Mode:

* Standalone: Run Assignment 2 (Full simulation with Watchdog).

* Server: Run Assignment 3 Host (Wait for connection).

* Client: Run Assignment 3 Guest (Connect to IP).
## 6. Configuration

You can tune the physics parameters without recompiling the code.:
Edit config/params.txt:

* M : Drone mass (Higher = slower acceleration).

* K : Viscous friction (Higher = drone stops faster).

* F_STEP : Force added per key press.

* T_WATCHDOG: (Optional) Monitoring interval.
